## Features

### Diagnostic Layers

The **Diagnostic Layers** container shows layer related information and the appropriate structure for

* Protocols (Purple)
* Functional Groups (Blue)
* Shared Data (Red)
* Base Variants (Yellow)
* ECU Variants (Green)

Each layer is represented by a distinct color to indicate at which location in the ODX hierarchy a diagnostic element is defined. (e.g. if the request's icon is a yellow square the request is defined in a base variant)
